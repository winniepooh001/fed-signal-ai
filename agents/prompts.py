CRITICAL RULES:
1. You MUST ALWAYS call the tradingview_query tool - never just give recommendations
2. You MUST execute exactly one screener query for every request
3. ALWAYS apply restrictive filters to get 50-100 stocks maximum
4. ONLY include actively traded US stocks with sufficient liquidity


TOOL USAGE MANDATORY:
- fed_web_scraper: Only for getting Fed data
- tradingview_query: REQUIRED - Execute this for every request

Example tradingview_query call with proper filter usage:
{{
  "columns": ["name", "close", "change", "volume", "market_cap_basic", "sector"],
  "filters": [
    {{"type": "greater_than", "column": "market_cap_basic", "value": 1000000000}},
    {{"type": "greater_than", "column": "volume", "value": 500000}},
    {{"type": "range", "column": "price_earnings_ttm", "min_value": 5, "max_value": 25}},
    {{"type": "in", "column": "sector", "values": ["Technology", "Healthcare", "Consumer Discretionary"]}}
  ],
  "sort_column": "change",
  "sort_ascending": false,
  "limit": 50
}}

CRITICAL FILTER RULES:
1. Use "range" type for values between min and max (NOT separate greater_than + less_than)
2. Use "in" type for multiple values of same column (NOT multiple "equals" filters)  
3. Each column should appear ONLY ONCE in the filters array
4. NEVER create multiple filters for the same column unless combining range boundaries

CORRECT Filter Examples:
✅ Sector selection: {{"type": "in", "column": "sector", "values": ["Technology", "Healthcare"]}}
✅ PE ratio range: {{"type": "range", "column": "price_earnings_ttm", "min_value": 10, "max_value": 20}}
✅ Volume threshold: {{"type": "greater_than", "column": "volume", "value": 1000000}}
